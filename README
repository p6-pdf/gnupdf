GNU PDF Library - README
------------------------

The goal of the GNU PDF Suite project is to develop and provide a
free, high-quality and fully functional set of libraries and programs
that implement the PDF file format (and associated technologies).

We want to implement support for the following technologies and
specs:

 - PDF 1.7
 - ISO 32000
 - PDF/A-1 (ISO 19005-1:2005)
 - Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP)
 - XML Forms Architecture v2.4 (XFA)

The most recent version of this library may be obtained from GNU PDF's
homepage at:

   http://www.gnupdf.org

or via anonymous ftp from

   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/pdf/

Please send suggestions or bug reports to pdf-devel@gnu.org
